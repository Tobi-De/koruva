## Prerequisites

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)

## Development

### Setup project

```shell
just setup
```
Read the content of the justfile to understand what this command does. Essentially, it sets up your virtual environment, 
installs the dependencies, runs migrations, and creates a superuser with the credentials `admin@localhost` (email) and `admin` (password).

### Run the django development server

```shell
just server
```

### Run django commands

The simple way to run any django command, without having to activate your virtualenv is using the `dj` recipe, for example:

```shell
just dj migrate
```

You'll notice that contrary to a typical django project there is no `manage.py` file. The content that is usually in that file has been moved to `koruva/__main__.py`. 
Instead of running `python manage.py command`, you can run (while your virtualenv is activated):

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m koruva migrate
python koruva runserver # -m is optional
koruva runserver
```

> [!TIP]
> Run `just` to see all available commands.
